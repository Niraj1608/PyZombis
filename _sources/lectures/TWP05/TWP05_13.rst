Variables changes along time
============================

+ A program is executed line by line.
+ So, the variables can change along the execution of your program

.. codelens:: cl_l05_13
    
    debt = 0 
    cost = 100
    debt = debt + cost
    cost = 200
    debt = debt + cost
    cost = 300
    debt = debt + cost
    print(debt)
